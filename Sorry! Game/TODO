COMMANDS AND CONTROLS
When the program starts, it asks the user for the settings: number of players, number of human players, number of pawns per player and number of pawns to cross the finish line.
After that, an window is opened with an empty board, the user must click on the spots he/she wants to place the deep pits with the left button of the mouse. Once he/she is done it`s necessary to press enter, then the user clicks on the spots to place the blackholes. Again once he/she is done it`s necessary to press enter.
After that, the game starts. The player then must press enter in order to roll the die.
After the die is rolled the player has to move one of his/her pieces forward/backward according to the number rolled.
This is done by clicking on the piece to be moved and pressing up or down arrows on the keyboard.
If the player does not want to move a piece it`s necessary to press enter.
Then it`s the next players turn to play.
The first player to get the pre-set amount of pawns to the finish line wins the game.
